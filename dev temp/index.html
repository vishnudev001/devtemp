		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>A registration form is a list of fields that a user will input data into and submit to a company or individual. There are many reasons why you would want a person to fill out a registration form. Companies use registration forms to sign up customers for subscriptions, services, or other programs or plans.</p>
		<p>Registration provides greater protection for the public. Members of the public can have confidence in knowing that a professional's standing and qualifications have been independently verified.</p>

				<h1>In this page to show the registration form and live clock</h1>
				<p>The registration page should be on your landing page and should not be listed on another website, for the best results. This way, your customer or client will not be tempted to leave your website before signing up.

					You should thoroughly check all fields on your registration form to make sure that they work properly and are formatted professionally.
					When optimizing your registration form, it is important to think about your call to action. It is often better to use the word ‘go’, or ‘send’ on your call-to-action button, rather than the word, ‘submit.’
					More on registration form optimization here.</p>

			    <blockquote><p>Registration forms on landing pages are very important and should be optimized in order to encourage the users to sign up for your email list, product, subscription or service.</p></blockquote>

				<h1>Live MyClockDisplay</h1>
				<p>Time is the continued sequence of existence and events that occurs in an apparently irreversible succession from the past, through the present, into the future.</p>
				<p>It is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as a fourth dimension, along with three spatial dimensions.</p>
				<p>The physical nature of time is addressed by general relativity with respect to events in spacetime. Examples of events are the collision of two particles, the explosion of a supernova, or the arrival of a rocket ship. Every event can be assigned four numbers representing its time and position (the event's coordinates). However, the numerical values are different for different observers. In general relativity, the question of what time it is now only has meaning relative to a particular observer. Distance and time are intimately related, and the time required for light to travel a specific distance is the same for all observers, as first publicly demonstrated by Michelson and Morley. General relativity does not address the nature of time for extremely small intervals where quantum mechanics holds</p>
